# DevTools Extension

When your app is running in debug mode, you can use the Hive CE Inspector to inspect boxes

## Opening the inspector

1. Open the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)
2. Select `Dart: Open DevTools`
3. Select `Open DevTools in Web Browser`
4. Navigate to the `hive_ce` tab

## Requirements

There are some requirements for using the inspector

- All types you wish to view in the inspector must have type adapters generated by a [GenerateAdapters](custom-objects/generate_adapters.md) annotation

?> For any types not handled by `GenerateAdapters`, only raw binary data will be shown

- Hive schemas (`hive_adapters.g.yaml`) are used to deserialize data
  - All necessary Hive schemas must be in the `lib` folder of a project open in the IDE workspace
  - This should work by default for most projects. Otherwise, you may need to copy the necessary Hive schemas into an open project's `lib` folder.
