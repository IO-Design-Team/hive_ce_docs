# Deprecation Policy

Since the goal of Hive CE is to never introduce breaking changes, APIs will not be marked as deprecated in code. However as Hive CE evolves, there will be improved APIs that are meant to replace old ones. This section contains the documentation of deprecated APIs that are still available, but have been replaced.
